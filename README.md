# Supercapacitor array performance visualization
This code is used to visualize the performance parameters (capacitance, voltage, energy, and power) of a supercapacitor array with various array configurations.

## How to use
Install pandas, plotly, and numpy library (cmd: pip install plotly pandas numpy).
Prepare the 2D data.xlsx file. Column A and B need to be changed according to the array size (default is 10x10). 
Column C, D, E, and F are capacitance, voltage, energy, and power, respectively. 
Different parameters may be used upon demand. In this case, index and column names should be changed accordinlgy.
